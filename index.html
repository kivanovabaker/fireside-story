      <p>It was a dark and stormy night... in the middle of Missouri. </p>
      <p>Cows as dark as night stood in the middle of the
           field. Their eyes dead and unblinking.
          On the outskirts of the field, a storm raged. The trees bent and quaked
        in the swiftly moving winds. But in the middle of the field, everything was still.
      Eerily still. </p>
      <p>One may ask why everything stood still, and they would not be wrong to do so.
          It was eerie and rather unnatural. A solitary goat stood upon a cow's back, looking at the sky.
          She had seen a...</p>
      <p>Fish emerge from a nearby pool, walking on it's fins as if they were legs. At first, the goat
            didn't believe what she had seen; fish didn't <em>walk</em> but then, as she witnessed more and more
            fish emerge from the the depths, she realized this was no dream. It was a nightmare!
      </p>
      <p>So there she stood, perched on a cow, quietly watching as the fish...</p>
      <p>Waltzed in unison out of the pond. Some wore mustaches, some had fancy hats.
        A few even had pocket watches. It was an odd sight to behold.</p>
      <p>One surly fish finally took notice of their stunned audience.
        He cleared his thoat. "Good evening, my lady," he spoke to the goat.
        "Anything I do for you this evening?"</p>
      <p>The goat, Sherry, opened her mouth to speak.</p>
