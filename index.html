      <p>It was a dark and stormy night... in the middle of Missouri. </p>
      <p>Cows as dark as night stood in the middle of the
           field. Their eyes dead and unblinking.
          On the outskirts of the field, a storm raged. The trees bent and quaked
        in the swiftly moving winds. But in the middle of the field, everything was still.
      Eerily still. </p>
